# Choreo App

A tool for learning choreography from video. Instead of endlessly 
rewinding, this app gives you precise controls to slow down, loop, 
and analyze movement in any video file.

## Features (in progress)
- Playback speed control
- Loop over custom start/stop points
- Frame-by-frame stepping
- Beat detection (kicks and snares visualized separately)
- Pose estimation overlay
- Encrypted storage and secure shareable links

## Tech Stack
- Python + FastAPI (backend)
- Flutter (mobile/desktop frontend, coming later)
- Librosa, MediaPipe, PyTorch (ML features)

## Setup
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Neel-Karkhanis/choreo-app.git
cd choreo-app

# create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
